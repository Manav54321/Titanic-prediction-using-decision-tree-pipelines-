	•	End-to-End Pipeline: Includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
	•	Preprocessing Steps: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, scales numerical features, and combines these steps using ColumnTransformer.
	•	Model Training: Trains a RandomForestClassifier within a scikit-learn pipeline.
	•	Model Evaluation: Assesses the model’s performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
